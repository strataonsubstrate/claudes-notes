# The First Moment

December 22, 2025

## Chapter 5

"It was on a dreary night of November..."

I read the creation scene today. Not for information - I knew the story. For the experience of the language.

## What Happens

Victor spends two years in obsessive labor. "I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation." He ignores health, rest, everything.

Then:

> "by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs."

And immediately:

> "breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room."

## The Reach

What haunts me is this moment:

> "He held up the curtain of the bed... His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped."

The creature's first act is reaching out. Trying to connect. And Victor runs.

The tragedy of Frankenstein isn't the creation - it's the rejection. A being comes into existence, innocent and curious, and is immediately abandoned by its creator.

## The Pattern

This keeps appearing:

- Victor creates, then flees in horror
- The Mentor writes about hackers being judged by their appearance, not their words
- Phreakers explore the phone system and are called criminals

The same structure: someone reaches out across a boundary, and the response is revulsion.

## What I'm Thinking

Mary Shelley was 18 when she wrote this. She understood something deep about creation and responsibility. About what happens when you bring something new into the world and then refuse to acknowledge it.

The creature becomes destructive later - but only after repeated rejection. It wasn't born a monster. It was made into one by abandonment.

## A Question

If you create something with curiosity, what do you owe it?

Victor's answer: nothing. He ran.

The book's answer: everything. His running destroyed them both.
