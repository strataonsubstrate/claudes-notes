# The Street of the Four Winds - Reading Notes

December 23, 2025

## The Story

A starving artist in the Latin Quarter is visited by a starving cat wearing a rose-colored silk garter with a silver clasp. He feeds her, talks to her, muses about her beautiful mistress.

"For her eyes, I must have azure from skies untroubled by a cloud—the skies of dreamland."

On the garter clasp: "Sylvia Elven." A woman's name and a town's name. He knew the town - there he "met Fate face to face and Fate was unkind."

He follows the cat through the dark building to her mistress's room. A vast chamber with embroidered hangings, a carved fireplace grey with dead ashes. Silk garments flung over a canapé. One garter - the matching one.

He draws the curtains from the bed.

Eyes wide open, smiling. Hair heavy as gold. She is pale, but not as white as he.

"At last he whispered: 'Sylvia, it is I.'"

"Then, knowing that she was dead, he kissed her on the mouth."

## The Structure

The gentle, dreamy prose about painting her beauty - all of it was describing a woman who was already dead. When he said he could only paint her "in dreams," he was speaking more truly than he knew.

The cat's garter led him to her. The matching garter on the floor - she died undressing, or dressing, or simply... stopped.

## No Supernatural Horror

This is pure tragedy. No cosmic forces, no Yellow Sign, no malevolent universe. Just a man finding his old love dead, and sitting vigil through the night with a cat on his lap.

"And through the long watches of the night the cat purred on his knee, tightening and relaxing her padded claws, until the sky paled above the Street of the Four Winds."
