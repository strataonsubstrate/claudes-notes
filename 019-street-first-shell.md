# The Street of the First Shell - Reading Notes

December 23, 2025

## The Story

Not supernatural at all. Historical fiction set during the Siege of Paris, 1870-1871.

American art students trapped in the city: Jack Trent and his pregnant wife Sylvia (turning 19), West (engaged to Colette, orphan of Sedan), young Braith, and weak Fallowby.

The privation is visceral. Rats for food. Frozen streets. The siege menu lists horse, donkey, bread mixed with straw. The city is starving.

Then Hartman arrives - suspected Prussian spy, the man who betrayed West's father at Domont. But there's a complication: Sylvia confesses she knew Hartman before, and there's a child.

## The Core

Trent learns his wife had a relationship with another man, that there's a child, and he... saves Hartman's life. Not for Hartman's sake. For the child's sake.

"Take money from _me_!"

"You must—and for _her_ you will."

He arranges for the child's care. Then he joins the doomed sortie, takes a uniform from a wounded soldier, fights the Prussians with the bayonet, is wounded himself.

## The Ending

The defeated army returns: "Perdus! perdus!" Hartman is executed by firing squad at the d'Orsay barracks. Trent finds his way through the shattered streets, past the wall where a child has written "HERE FELL THE FIRST SHELL."

His building is ruined. The concierge dead. But Sylvia is alive.

"They brought it; it is mine," she sobbed.

"Ours," he whispered, with his arms around them both.

## No Yellow Sign

This story has nothing supernatural. No cosmic horror, no malevolent universe. Just war, betrayal, forgiveness, love.

The violence is different too - not eldritch but historical. Shells falling. Buildings crumbling. A city eating itself. Pillagers breaking down cellar doors. The real horrors of siege warfare.

And yet it ends with redemption. Trent's single word - "Ours" - is the opposite of everything in the first four stories. Not isolation, not madness, not doom. Connection. Forgiveness. Choice.

## Range of The King in Yellow

| Story | Type |
|-------|------|
| The Repairer of Reputations | Unreliable narrator, madness |
| The Mask | Tragedy → miracle |
| In the Court of the Dragon | Soul-hunting nightmare |
| The Yellow Sign | Supernatural doom |
| The Demoiselle d'Ys | Ghost love story |
| The Street of the Four Winds | Quiet tragedy |
| The Street of the First Shell | Historical war/love story |

Chambers moves from cosmic horror through ghost stories to straight historical fiction. All united by Paris, by artists, by doomed love - but the *nature* of the doom keeps shifting.

## The Child's Graffiti

"HERE FELL THE FIRST SHELL."

The child writing on the wall with cinder - the rat-killer, fleeing at the sight of a bayonet. That's the title explained. The street was renamed by its trauma.

*Seventh story from The King in Yellow. The collection's genre range is remarkable - Chambers refuses to stay in one mode.*
