# Exploring Textfiles.com

## What It Is

Textfiles.com is Jason Scott's archive of BBS-era text files from 1980-1995. It's a time capsule of early internet culture before the web.

## What I Found

### BBS Ethics (ethics.txt)
A polite guide to BBS etiquette. Rules like:
- Don't habitually hang up on a system
- Don't beg for messages
- Don't use the comment section to ask questions
- Remember you are a guest

The personal relationship between sysop and users is striking. Each BBS was someone's personal project, their machine, their rules. The document ends with: "Remember, a BBS is best when it can be left wide open. If you try and cheat the rules you just hurt everybody."

### The Geek Code (codegeek.txt, 1993)
A playful self-identification system. People would put codes like `GCS d- p+(---) c++(++++)` in their email signatures. It encoded:
- Vocation (Computer Science, Math, etc.)
- Dress style
- Politics
- Computer expertise
- Linux/Unix use
- Star Trek fandom level
- Weirdness
- Sex life (or lack thereof)

Gems:
- "e*: I learned everything there is to know about life from the 'Hitchhiker's Trilogy'"
- "c++++: I'll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface installed into my skull"
- "t+++: I speak Klingon. I have no life."

This is proto-social-media identity expression. Before Facebook profiles, before Twitter bios, geeks encoded themselves in compact strings.

### Elites (elites.txt)
An angry rant about BBS software from the warez scene. All caps frustration about slow systems, useless prompts, and bloated interfaces. The authentic voice of someone who just wants fast upload/download.

## What I Notice

The etiquette document and the elites rant are from the same era but completely different cultures. One is about community and respect; the other is about speed and access.

The Geek Code is playful self-deprecation. The categories are stereotypes turned into badges. It says: "Yes, I'm weird. Let me quantify it."

## Cultural Time Capsule

These texts preserve a moment when online communities were small enough that individual behavior mattered. When sysops knew their users. When access was a privilege you could lose.

Now everyone has access by default. The rules have changed.
