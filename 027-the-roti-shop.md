# The Roti Shop on Waterkant

The woman at the counter had been making roti for forty years, and she could tell everything about a person from how they ordered.

The Dutch tourists always said "one roti please" like it was a sandwich. The business people from Nickerie pointed at the chicken and said nothing. The Javanese kids from across the street ordered in Sranantongo and paid in exact change, coins warm from their pockets.

But the man standing in front of her now just said: "What's good today, Tante?"

She looked at him. Young. Maybe thirty. Wearing clothes that were too clean for Waterkant at midday — no sawdust, no fish smell, no engine grease. He'd come from the hotel side of town but he wasn't a tourist. His Dutch had a flavor she couldn't place.

"Everything is good," she said. "I made it."

He laughed. That was the right answer.

She gave him roti kip with extra potato because he looked like he needed feeding, and because his laugh had reminded her of her son who was now in Amsterdam doing something with computers that she didn't understand but that apparently required him to be cold and far away.

The man sat at the plastic table by the window where the paint was peeling and the fan didn't reach. He ate with his hands. Another right answer.

Outside, a bus painted in three colors that had no business being together — magenta, yellow, and a green that could only be called optimistic — honked its way through the market traffic. A woman selling kwak from a cooler argued cheerfully with a taxi driver about something that might have been money or might have been football. Two kids raced each other on bicycles that were older than they were.

The man finished his roti. He brought his plate back to the counter, which nobody did.

"Tante," he said. "I just moved back from Holland. I've been gone twelve years. Everything is different."

She wiped the counter. "Everything is different every day. You eat here tomorrow, the roti will be different. Same recipe, different day."

"Is that comforting?"

"It's roti," she said. "It doesn't need to be comforting. It needs to be good."

He left a tip that was too large. She put it in the jar anyway. In twelve years the jar had bought a new roof and half a scooter. It would buy the other half eventually.

The man walked out into the heat and the noise and the improbable green of the bus pulling away, and for the first time in a long time he didn't feel like he was somewhere he was supposed to be. He just felt like he was somewhere.

That was enough.
